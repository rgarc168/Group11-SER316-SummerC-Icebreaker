One rainy day in Berline, I was taking a walk down to my local Ratskeller.
I was really craving Bratwurst.
I decided to stop in to grab one at a Biergarten off the Hauptstrasse.
As I bit in to the bratwurst I realized it was covered in Gebaeck.
It made me really crave an apfelkuchen for some reason.
It reminded me of childhood summers in the countryside of Raesfeld.
I unfortunately have not been back since my childhood... since the incident with the hunds.
When I was a child, I was walking past my favorite Doner Kebap stand when I heard barking.
A big Doberman was hanging out of a BMW with the klimaanlage blasting.
It was probably checking out my sweet lederhose.
Maybe the hund wasn't some food. I should have stopped at the Baeckerei to get a Gebaeck.
